                        </div>
                        <p>
                          As a founding partner and senior executive at CityMD, Nedal has fostered a people-first philosophy, a guiding principle that is embedded within the ethos
                          of the organization. He served as the organization's first Chief Operation Officer and currently leads the growth team as Chief Strategy Officer. </br></br>
                          His primary focus is to ensure the company continues its rapid growth trajectory through a combination of retail development, strategic innovation, and
                          payer and health system relationship management. He continues to work to differentiate the brand and ensure that product evolution meets the consumers’
                          dynamic needs.<br>Under his leadership, the company has seen tremendous growth, from 6 units in 2013 to over 100 retail stores in the Northeast. Nedal
                          developed and executed a de novo and M&A growth strategy, positioning CityMD as the dominant urgent care provider in the Northeast and one of the largest
                          privately held urgent care practices in the United States. Today, CityMD has seen over 5 million visits and is a national leader in the delivery of care,
                          with a people first - patient first philosophy, that continues to guide the organization forward.</br></br>Nedal serves on the board of directors to CityMD,
                          a Warburg Pincus portfolio company. He developed and now chairs the company's captive medical malpractice company, and is the executive sponsor and President

                          appointments at both Saint Luke’s-Roosevelt Hospital and The Valley Hospital. He continues to serve as an associate professor at New York Presbyterian-Weill
                          Cornell Medical Center. He received his Bachelor's degree from New York University and went on to obtain his medical degree at University College Dublin,
                          graduating with Cum Laude Honors. Nedal completed his internship in Internal Medicine at Montefiore Medical Center in New York and went on to complete his
                          residency in Emergency Medicine at North Shore-LIJ/Albert Einstein College of Medicine, where he was the Chief Resident. Nedal is passionate about service to
                          charitable organizations, participating in medical missions to developing countries. In 2011, he traveled to Haiti to lead a medical team following a

                          Upon graduating, the two took a cross country road trip to explore the dining landscape while building their business plan and
                          opening menu. In 2001, Chopt opened its first location in Union Square in NYC and has since grown to over 50 locations across
                          seven states.</br></br>Tony believes that dining at Chopt should feel like flipping through the pages of a travel magazine. To that
                          end, he can most often be found traveling across the country or around the world in search of the most craveable flavors, interesting
                          ingredients, and talented artisans to share with others.<br>When he's not on the road, you'll find him tucked away in a booth at any
                          one of the Chopt locations munching on the latest salad innovation and dreaming up where his flavor missions will take him next.
